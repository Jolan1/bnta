/*Exercise 1

Given any string such as "a,b,b,c,c,c,z" write a function that return the number of occurrences for each letter

Think a a suitable data structures that can be used to solve this problem.

Exercise 2
Given a string such as ({()})
Implement a function that checks if the opening bracket/parenthesis has a corresponding closing bracket/parenthesis.

For example:
    if input is "({()})" function should return true
    if input is "({})" function should return true
    if input is "()" function should return true
    if input is "({( })" function should return false
    if input is "({()}" function should return false

Think a suitable data structures that can be used to solve this problem.*/
